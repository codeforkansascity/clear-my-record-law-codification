### FBI & Missouri State Central Repository

It is important for persons filing expungement petitions to name the Missouri State Central Repository and FBI, 
otherwise, the criminal history databases that house the criminal history record information 
for the state and FBI will not be cleared of the arrest(s)
named in the petition should the petition be granted.
