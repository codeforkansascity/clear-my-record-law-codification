## Information Needed

Need three list of statutes,  

1. offense of assault
2. offense of domestic assault
3. offense of kidnapping

How do we find these statues, for example kidnapping when kidnapping is not in the name?



Senario:

If they are recklessly  driving their motor scooter and kill someone, they would be charged with:
* Recklessly driving their motor scooter (Felony). does not mention anything about death
