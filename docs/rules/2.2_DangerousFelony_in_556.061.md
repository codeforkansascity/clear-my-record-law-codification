## Information Needed

We neet to know:

1. If the charge is convicted as a felony.
2. *Need to review to see if there is other data we need to colect*
3. If the charge is a "dangerous felony" under 556.061.(19) - verify law citation
    *  Research subdivision (14) of section 565.002
    *  Research 568.060
    *  Research 565.153
    *  

Assumptions:

* This applies to the charge and does not disqualify the case.
  

## UX

When displaying a statute that is not elagible 

"Can not expunge since charge due to 610.140.2(2 as the charge is a dangerous felony."

## Database

* Charge is a felony.  The database currently has 
   * [`charges.conviction_charge_type`](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/clear-my-record-law-codification/tree/main/database-elements): Felony, Misdemeanor, ...
* The statute is a dangerous felony
   * ADD `statute.dangerous_felony`


### Add `statues.dangerous_felony` flag

Flag has the following options:

* is a dangerous felony
* is NOT a dangerous felony
* Not determined

How to initalize?

1. Set all statutes to NOT a dangerous felony.
2. Set known statutes that are a dangerous felony to true.

How to maintain?

1. Have someone watch the changes in law
2. Have lawyers look for errors (sanity check)
3. Will need to be maintained more frequently then some other elements.

## Logic

```
if charges.conviction_charge_type == Felony
and statute.dangerous_felony is true
Then
   Charge cannot be expunged
```
