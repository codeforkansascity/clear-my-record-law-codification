# (2)  Any dangerous felony as that term is defined in section 556.061

## Logic

* For all statutes that cannot be charged as a Felony, mark Does Not Apply.
* We are creating a list of statute numbers from the 562.061 definitions of dangerous felony and those will be marked Exception Applies.

This will leave 472 statutes as Undetermined.

## Law

610.140.2(2) Any dangerous felony as that term is defined in section 556.061;

[556.061(19) "Dangerous felony", *reformatted for readability*](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/clear-my-record-law-codification/wiki/556.061(19)-Dangerous-felony---reformatted-for-readability)





## Information Needed

We neet to know:

1. If the charge is convicted as a felony.
2. We will not process things under 577.001.
3. *Need to review to see if there is other data we need to collect*
4. If the charge is a "dangerous felony" under 556.061.(19) - verify law citation
    *  Research subdivision (14) of section 565.002
    *  Research 568.060
    *  Research 565.153


# Discussion is

If statute is NOT A FELONY IT DOES NOT APPLY.

attempted rape in the first degree if *physical injury results*, 
is covered in rape in the first degree [https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=566.030](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=566.030), 

* Lexis would not show physical injury results
* CaseNet might show physical injury results

Charging document will have “Forcible Rape in the First Degree with injury [RSMo 556.061]"

Logic

if a 566.030.2 determine if was there "physical injury"
   See Charging document or other information
