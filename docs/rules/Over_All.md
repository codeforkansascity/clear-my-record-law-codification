# Strategy

One of the primary questions asked of this system is, is a given statute expungeable.  We have several answers:

1. Yes it is expungeable
2. No it is not, and we would like to answer why it is not.
3. It is expungeable in certain cases. (possible).  We need to indicate what to check.
4. Call a lawyer
5. Undetermined

To to this we need
1. A list of all statutes that our clients would possibly check.
   * Mark statutes Undetermined
3. A list of sections in 610.140 that disqualifies a statute from being expunged and any conditions.
4. For each statute in 2, 3, 4
   * Match it with section of 610.140 that disqualifies it
   * Mark it as Not expungeable, Possibly expungeable or Call a Lawyer.
5. For any statute that is expungeable, mark it expungable

# How to maintain?

1. Have someone watch the changes in law
2. Have lawyers look for errors (sanity check)
3. Will need to be maintained more frequently then some other elements.

# Questions

Can a single charge disqualify all other charges in a case?  See Dean Suni.

# Assumptions:

* A charge that is not expungable and does not disqualify the case.
