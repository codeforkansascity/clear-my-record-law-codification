# Strategy

One of the primary questions asked of this system is, is a given statute expugnable.  We have several answers:

1. Yes it is expugnable
2. No it is not, and we would like to answer why it is not.
3. It is expugnable in certain cases. (possible).  We need to indicate what to check.
4. Call a lawyer
5. Undetermined

To to this we need 
1. A list of all statutes that our clients would possibly check.
   * Mark statutes Undetermined
3. A list of sections in 610.140 that disqualifies a statute from being expunged and any conditions.
4. For each statute in 2, 3, 4
   * Match it with section of 610.140 that disqualifies it
   * Mark it as Not expugnable, Possibly expugnable or Call a Lawyer.
5. For any statute that is expugnable, mark it Expugnable
