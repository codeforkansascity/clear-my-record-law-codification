# 2(11)  Any offense of section 571.030, except any offense under subdivision (1) of subsection 1 of section 571.030 where the person was convicted or found guilty prior to January 1, 2017.

Charge date in Clinic App can be used to calculate if it was prior to Jan 1, 2017.

Will need to talk to client to see if it was a "consealed wepon". or review court records

for the date requierment, the date of deposition in or system should be the cate of conviction.

NOTE: May neeed to go back to court documents to determine this since the charge is often listed at 571.030(1-4) not just (1).

OR if they convicted of 1.1 and the date, otherwise it cannot be expunged.
