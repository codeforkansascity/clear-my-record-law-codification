19-Jul-2021 we think we can use the Charge Code Manule colum SOR.

[589.414.  Registrant's duties on change of information â€” change in online identifiers, duty to report.](https://www.revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=589.414) contains a list of statutes to be considered. We will need to research all of the statutes mentioned in 589.414. Suggested by Professor Suni 12-Apr-2021
