How to initalize?

19-Jul-2021 we think we can use the Charge Code Manule colum SOR.

[589.414.  Registrant's duties on change of information â€” change in online identifiers, duty to report.](https://www.revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=589.414) contains a list of statutes to be considered. We will need to research all of the statutes mentioned in 589.414. Suggested by Professor Suni 12-Apr-2021

There may be 63 or so statutes under 589.414

Missouri State Highway Patrol keeps a data set relating to charge codes that tie back to the statutes. A statute possibly requiering regestration as a sex offender is listed in this data set. the charge should be over inclusive, listing cases where a statute may or may not, but we should aim for that rather than being under inclusive and inform attorneys of that choice.
