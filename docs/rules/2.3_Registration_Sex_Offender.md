# 610.140.2(3) Any offense that requires registration as a sex offender;

## Information Needed

We neet to know:

1. Does the offense requires registration as a sex offender.

Assumptions:

* This applies to the charge and does not disqualify the case.
  

## UX

When displaying a statute that is not elagible 

## Database

* The Offince requires_sex_offender as a sex offended.
   * ADD `statute.requires_sex_offender`


### Add `statues.requires_sex_offender` flag

Flag has the following options:

* Offince requires sex offender registeation
* Offince does not requires sex offender registration
* Possible: Must review statute since there are clauses that require information outside of data that we are collecting (age of victim)
* Not determined

How to initalize?

[589.414.  Registrant's duties on change of information â€” change in online identifiers, duty to report.](https://www.revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=589.414) contains a list statues to be considered.  Suggested by Perfessor Suni 12-Apr-2021

How to maintain?

1. Have someone watch the changes in law
2. Have lawyers look for errors (sanity check)
3. Will need to be maintained more frequently then some other elements.

## Logic

```
if charges.requires_sex_offender == True
Then
   Charge cannot be expunged
```
