# 2(1)  Any class A felony offense;

We will look at the Charge Type & Class to determine how the conviction was clasified

## Data Source

* other sources- Casenet
* MSHP - is the best source of what is charged.
[PLEASE VERIFY]

## Logic

```
if charges.conviction_charge_type == Felony
and charges.conviction_class_type == A
Then
   Conviction is NOT expungable
```

## Law

2(1)  Any class A felony offense;

Assumptions:

* This applies to the charge and does not disqualify the case.
  
Senario:

What happens if they "Down Grade" to a M?


## UX

When displaying a statute that is not elagible 

"Can not expunge since charge due to 610.140.1(2 as the conviction is a class A felony."

## Database

* Conviction is a felony.  The database currently has 
   * [`charges.conviction_charge_type`](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/clear-my-record-law-codification/tree/main/database-elements): Felony, Misdemeanor, ...
