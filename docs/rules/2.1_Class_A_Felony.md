# 2(1)  Any class A felony offense;

We will look at the Charge Type & Class to determine how the conviction was clasified

## Logic
* For statutes that are only one Charge Code of a F/A (Felony A) we will mark them as Exception Applies
* For statutes where there are both F/A and other levels in the Charge Codes, we will mark them Exception Possibly Applies
* For all other statutes, mark as Does Not Apply.
